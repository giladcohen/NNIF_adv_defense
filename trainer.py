"""
Multi-replica synchronous training


NOTE: This module is much more free to change than many other modules
in CleverHans. CleverHans is very conservative about changes to any
code that affects the output of benchmark tests (attacks, evaluation
methods, etc.). This module provides *model training* functionality
not *benchmarks* and thus is free to change rapidly to provide better
speed, accuracy, etc.

                   are (re)initialized, otherwise only previously
                   uninitialized variables are initialized before training.
  :param evaluate: function that is run after each training iteration
                   (typically to display the test/validation accuracy).
  :param feed: An optional dictionary that is appended to the feeding
               dictionary before the session runs. Can be used to feed
               the learning phase of a Keras model for instance.
  :param args: dict or argparse `Namespace` object.
               Should contain `nb_epochs`, `learning_rate`,
               `batch_size`
  :param rng: Instance of numpy.random.RandomState
  :param var_list: Optional list of parameters to train.

      Takes a single tensor containing an x_train batch as input
      Returns a single tensor containing an x_train batch as output
      Called to preprocess the data before passing the data to the Loss
  :param use_ema: bool
      If true, uses an exponential moving average of the model parameters
  :param ema_decay: float or callable
      The decay parameter for EMA, if EMA is used
      If a callable rather than a float, this is a callable that takes
      the epoch and batch as arguments and returns the ema_decay for
      the current batch.
  :param loss_threshold: float
      Raise an exception if the loss exceeds this value.
      This is intended to rapidly detect numerical problems.
      Sometimes the loss may legitimately be higher than this value. In
      such cases, raise the value. If needed it can be np.inf.
  :param dataset_train: tf Dataset instance.
      Used as a replacement for x_train, y_train for faster performance.
  :param dataset_size: integer, the size of the dataset_train.
